# Icebox
 - [ ] make it work with new PrusaSlicer
 - [ ] test if new PrusaSlicer profiles work?
 - [ ] make it easier to see what files you've selected in the gui
 - [ ] clean up code
 - [ ] stabilize back end

# Sprint
## Target Release Date: 2019-06-30
### Goals:
 - [x] add screenshot to justification section
 - [x] do I want to remove clamp-bolt? We don't use it. Could I use it at some
   point?

 - [x] make it work with arbitrary exported slic3r profile
   - [x] This will be useful when slicing airplane parts!
 - [x] open gcode sliced with new profile to check if it's working
   - [x] inspected gcode: custom profile is not working. Why not? (FIXED)
   - [x] okay that's not EXACTLY right. The 1cm cube generated by the test has
     the profile applied, but the file sliced with the cli does not?
 - [x] add cli and gui interfaces for custom profile
   - [x] cli
   - [x] gui
 - [x] custom profile work was done on the wrong branch! Cherry pick those
   commits to custom-slicing-profile and then roll back on this branch.
 - [x] get current directory and use that as default value for profile instead
   of './'. For consistency.
    - we don't do this in core.py, why should we do it in gui.py?
 - [ ] give error when file input is not a slic3r-pe file
    - looks like I need to validate this myself.... slic3r goes ahead and tires
      to slice it when only given bad settings
    - inspect .ini profile? Or inspect output .gcode? Output gcode doesn't seem
      to have any time info when given a bad profile. How would I check for a
      bad profile? I'd have to determine what settings are needed to get an
      accurate estimate... that sounds tough
    - [ ] how about I just check if the first line is the "Generated by Slic3r" 
          comment inserted by slic3r?
    - [ ] support profiles only from 1.42.0? Or newer ones as well?
 - [ ] what if user doesn't supply filament density/cost?
    - [ ] add to README that they should if they want mass/cost estimates
    - [ ] if they don't, make it so regex doesn't fail
    - [ ] if they don't, make it so the program warns the user about how they
          won't get those estimates
    - order in gcode:
      - filament used, by length/volume
      - filament used, by mass
      - filament cost
      - estimated print time (normal)
 - [ ] in file where print stats are output, include print settings
 - [ ] get print bed size programatically

 - [ ] modify text output: just show file name, not full path. still clip off
   long names.
 - [ ] in output, include and location of gcodes
 - [ ] file names: don't include layer height

 - [ ] update windows build script to automatically zip files like the linux
   script
 - [ ] do I want to strip down .gcode files so that they don't dramatically
   affect github statistics?
    - I'm afraid removing extra information would make the test less realistic:
      whole files have to be loaded; a file will never have ONLY estimates
    - also what does it matter if the files are longer? Scraping the files is
      incredibly fast, even for large-box-0.3mm.gcode. There's also no
      reasonable risk of a computer running out of memory with the 'big' gcodes
### Stretch:
 - [ ] deploy to pypi

## Target Release Date: 2019-06-02
### Goals:
 - [x] have basic GUI that takes input .stl files and outputs a prediction in a
   text file.
 - [x] make output properly formatted
 - [x] make it work cross-platform
   - [x] FIX FAILING TEST
     - okay so this is more complicated than it may 
     initially seem. The easiest way I can think of making this happen is by
     making the tests aware of the globals in core.... Which I don't even know
     if that's possible? Might be better to make core a class and make the
     globals into class variables.
     - potential solution: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3400652
 - [x] DEPLOY BINARIES
   - how do I want to deploy? How hard is it to make an appimage? 
     how hard is it to deploy to PyPi? I think I'm going to start by 
     building .exe files for windows and mac/linux users can just 
     run from source
   - [x] pyInstaller works
   - [x] test the exe
   - [x] fix loading gif
   - [x] make cancel button work
   - [x] find out why that one window is just hanging out when it's supposed to
     be closed?
   - [x] 'slicing was cancelled' error always comes up, even when there is no
     error
   - [x] ~~package slic3r-pe with exe~~ will just manually copy bin directory 
   alongside .exe

### Stretch:
 - [x] make build file for pyinstaller, add external files so that they get
   built into the .exe
 - [x] update readme

# Log of what's been done:
 - [x] how will I add times together? Make time object? Switch language?
   - [x] Is there any benefit in continuing to use bash over something like
         python?
   - [x] Can I run slic3r appimage from python?
 - [x] how to get gcode to actually include filament cost?
 - [x] get approx filament cost from slic3r gcode
 - [x] test scrape from support-test.gcode
 - [x] what happens if the model takes more than a day?
 - [x] test scrape from large-box.gcode
 - [x] clean up code
 - [x] write tests for slicing/scraping multiple models
 - [x] write function that aggregates results of scraping data from gcodes
 - [x] port get-slic3r-pe.sh to a python function in core.py
 - [x] combine it all, build an interface
 - [x] make tests faster
   - [x] look at pytest-profiling (ended up using pytest --durations=0)
   - [x] how can I make a fast test that will give a multiple-day print time?
     - [x] don't need to slice the model! Just need to scrape data from gcode.
       The function that has the edge case with multi-day prints is the scrape
       function.
 - [x] fix error when slicing crank.stl that says there are no layers
   - [x] start by writing a failing test for crank.
 - [x] add argparse so I can add things like output
 - [x] make it so I can save output to file
 - [x] make output sortable (by print time or filament usage... they should
       result in the same sorted order though right?)
 - [x] test length of text in name of gcode... maybe do full length in text
       file and short length in terminal? Mmm... it'd be useful to also have
       full length in terminal I think.
 - [x] run pylint, make requested changes
 - [x] ~~get newest version, even when newest version number changes~~
   - [x] ~~is this a good idea? what if they change how the gcode is
     formatted?~~
   - [x] this is a bad idea
